## NextJS & TailwindCss:
#### This project was a learning experience as It was my first project using both of them.

## React's DateRangePicker component:
#### Used this component library to let users pick the duration of the stay with preselects like current month / week.

## Mapbox:
#### I used Mapbox API to customize the map component. For example, I used Airbnb's brand color to display Streets and Highways.

## Resposive design:
#### Tailwind simplified the normal media queries work of changing components styling based on screen ration.
